Project 1: Test Case Descriptions

Test Case ID: filetransfer_01

Test Case Description: 
Test that data can be successfully sent from server to client and written to a 
specified file location.

Prerequisites: 
This test requires a stable internet connection, access to the UCCS 
VPN (if testing from outside the UCCS campus), access to the UCCS Linux servers,
and a computer. To set-up the program for compilation and running, please refer to 
the instructions provided in the README.txt file.

Environment Information:
OS: macOS Sequoia 15.4.1
System: Macbook Air M1, 2020

Test Scenario: 
After set-up, check that the client is able to request a file from the 
server and have the data successfully transferred and copied to the specified file 
location in client_files. 

Test Steps:
1. Set-up the client and server using the instructions provided in the README.txt file
2. Enter the command ```./client localhost transmit_me.txt``` in the client terminal
3. Observe the messages printed to terminal
4. Navigate to client_files/received_file to ensure that the file has been received 
and copied successfully. Check for data loss or corruption.

Expected Results:
The data contained in client_files/received_file matches the contents of transmit_me.txt
exactly.

Actual Results (data contained in client_files/received_file):
The data contained in client_files/received_file does not match the contents of
transmit_me.txt, and appears to be corrupted. The first portion of the text is 
missing, and garbage characters are present. 

Status: Fail

Comments:
According to the debugging statements which have been printed to the terminal, the client 
resends the acknowledgment for the first frame every time without fail. It seems that the 
server does not receive the first frame. However, these statements also indicate that the 
rest of the data is transmitted and received successfully.

Test Case ID: filetransfer_02

Test Case Description: 
Test that data can be successfully sent from server to client and written to a 
specified file location.

Prerequisites: 
This test requires a stable internet connection, access to the UCCS 
VPN (if testing from outside the UCCS campus), access to the UCCS Linux servers,
and a computer. To set-up the program for compilation and running, please refer to 
the instructions provided in the README.txt file.

Environment Information:
OS: macOS Sequoia 15.4.1
System: Macbook Air M1, 2020

Test Scenario: 
After set-up, check that the client is able to request a file from the 
server and have the data successfully transferred and copied to the specified file 
location in client_files. 

Test Steps:
1. Set-up the client and server using the instructions provided in the README.txt file
2. Enter the command ```./client localhost transmit_me.txt``` in the client terminal
3. Observe the messages printed to terminal
4. Navigate to client_files/received_file to ensure that the file has been received 
and copied successfully. Check for data loss or corruption.

Expected Results (data contained in client_files/received_file):
The data contained in client_files/received_file matches the contents of transmit_me.txt
exactly.

Actual Results (data contained in client_files/received_file):
The data contained in client_files/received_file matches the contents of transmit_me.txt
exactly.

Status: Pass

Comments:
After diagnosing the issue and ensuring that the client and server sequence
numbers are synchronized, the data from the file transmit_me.txt is now 
successfully transmitted from server to client and written to the file location 
client_files/received_file. The debugging comments printed to the terminal no 
longer indicates any retransmission events, and all sent/received sequence numbers
and acknowledgments are as expected.
