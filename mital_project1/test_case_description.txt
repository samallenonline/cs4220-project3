Test Case 1 : File doesn't exist
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
Serverside outputs "Error: Something went wrong while opening file; check it exists", then serverside and clientside close

Test Case 2 : input_file.txt contains FRAME_SIZE number of bytes
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
Client outputs client_files/recieved.txt, which exactly matches input_file.txt, then serverside and clientside close

Test Case 3 : input_file.txt contains less than FRAME_SIZE number of bytes
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
Client outputs client_files/recieved.txt, which exactly matches input_file.txt, then serverside and clientside close

Test Case 4 : input_file.txt contains FRAME_SIZE + 1 number of bytes
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
Client outputs client_files/recieved.txt, which exactly matches input_file.txt, then Serverside and clientside close

Test Case 5: client started, but not server
1. Start clientside
Client outputs "Error: Something went wrong when connecting server; status: -1", then client closes

Test Case 6 : server is closed before entire file is transferred
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
3. Close serverside
Client outputs "Lost connection to server, closing connection...", then client closes

Test Case 7 : client is closed before entire file is transferred
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
3. Close clientside
Server outputs "Lost connection to client, closing server connection...", then server closes

Test Case 8 : Server sends sequence number of 0 when client was expected a sequence number of 1
Prerequsite: Must have a slow, inconsistent connection
1. Start serverside
2. Start clientside
3. Server sends data
4. Timeout occurs
5. Server sends data
6. Client recieves data
7. Client recieves data
Client sends back ACK of 1, server reevaluates the sequence number and resends data, so everything is back in sync
